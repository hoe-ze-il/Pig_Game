# Pig Game Rules

## **Overview**

Pig is a two-player dice game where the goal is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 or more points. Players take turns rolling a standard six-sided die and accumulating points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all their current points for that turn, and their turn ends. Players can choose to "hold" their accumulated points at any time, adding them to their total score. The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.

## **Setup**

1. Decide who goes first. You can do this by flipping a coin, rolling a die, or any other agreed-upon method.
2. Each player starts with a total score of 0.

## **Gameplay**

1. On a player's turn, they roll a standard six-sided die (a single die with faces numbered 1 through 6).
2. If the player rolls a:
    - **1**: Their turn ends immediately, and they lose all the points accumulated during that turn. Control passes to the other player, and their score remains unchanged.
    - **2 through 6**: The number rolled is added to the player's current turn total, and they can choose to:
        - Roll again (choose "Roll" option) to accumulate more points on the same turn.
        - Hold (choose "Hold" option) to add the accumulated points to their total score, ending their turn.
3. Players take turns, rolling the die and accumulating points until:
    - They choose to "hold" and add their current turn total to their total score.
    - They roll a 1, which causes them to lose all their current turn points, and the other player takes their turn.
4. The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game immediately, ending the game.

## **Winning the Game**

The player who reaches or surpasses 100 points first is declared the winner. They do not need to reach exactly 100 points; any total score greater than or equal to 100 will suffice.

## **Optional Rules**

You can customize the game with optional rules, such as:

- Setting a higher or lower target score to win.
- Allowing players to decide whether they lose all their points on a roll of 1 or just their current turn points.
- Playing with more than two players, taking turns in a clockwise order.
- Using two dice instead of one for faster gameplay and more scoring variability.

## **Enjoy the Game!**

Pig is a fun and straightforward game of chance and strategy. Roll the dice, accumulate points, and decide when to play it safe by holding your score. May the best roller win!
